    <h1>Past Coding Experience</h1>
    <p>Growing up, society was not very computer-dependent as it is today.
      We went to the library when we had to do research for a school project or paper.
      If I remember correclty, our first computer was an <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/ibm5155.html">
        IBM 5155 portable personal computer</a> which had to boot from a floppy drive and ran DOS.</p>

    <h2>Seagate Crystal</h2>
    <p>My first coding expeirence was at work while using a program
      (<a href="https://www.blackbaud.com/files/support/guides/afn/crystal_reports_7_users_guide.pdf">Seagate Crystal</a>)
      to generate reports. This program pulls data from a database and analyzes it according to how the user
      writes the report. It can be written to simply return raw data or show visual representations such as graphs. It
      can also be programmed to perform mathematical calculations to find sub-totals, totals, and percentages
      (just to name a few). At work, these reports are referred to as "Crystal Reports" or "Crystals" for short.
      It is amazing on how the final product can look so simple, yet no one is aware of the complicated formulas written
      in order to get those results. Aside from familiar text boxes, the majority of all data shown on the report has some
      sort of formula or code behind it. I self-taught myself on how to, at first, tweak reports given to me to then writing
      my own from scratch. I developed this skill exponentially and am now able to write extremely complicated reports.
      Due to sensitive content, I am unable to show pictures of reports that I have made.
