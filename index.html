<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> One of the things I enjoy most are the fun aspects of science and technology. Although I am unfortunately
not the smartest or most technologically-advanced individual, I like to appear that I know more than I actually do.
I've found some entertaining videos and merchandise that help "make fun" of science. For all my fellow "Geeks" visit
the website <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">thinkgeek.com</a> for a lot of "nerdy" (mostly) useful items.

<h3> I actually own these T-shirts (purchased from <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">thinkgeek.com:</a>)</h3>
<p>(I have a personal fondness for Pi due to the fact that I was born on 3/14)</p>
