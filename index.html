            <h1>About Me</h1>
              <p> One of the things I enjoy most are the fun aspects of science and technology. Although I am unfortunately
                not the smartest or most technologically-advanced individual, I like to appear that I know more than I actually do.
                I've found some entertaining videos and merchandise that help "make fun" of science. For all my fellow "Geeks" visit
                the website <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">thinkgeek.com</a> for a lot of "nerdy" (mostly) useful items.
